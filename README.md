# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the JavaScript language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used VS Code as the source of documenting the program. I utilized HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game and messages display to the internet browser, using HTML. I used CSS to do a little bit of formatting and visualization including a background image.

I primarily used javascript to handle my program with some assistance from CSS and HTML. Using Javascript, I created several functions that allow the user to select options, show the text, as well as testNodes to handle the different scenarios and events.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I'd like to add more scenarios or make them a little more diverse.
- I'd like to edit some of the HTML and CSS a little further to make the contrast better and the background image nicer.
- Some of the alignment of the text could be improved and I'd also like to allow the user to restart at any point of the game.
