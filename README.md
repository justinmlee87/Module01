# Development Environment

I used VS Code as the source of documenting the program. I utilized HTML, CSS and Javascript. The game and messages display to the internet browser, using HTML. I used CSS to do a little bit of formatting and visualization including a background image.

I primarily used javascript to handle my program with some assistance from CSS and HTML. Using Javascript, I created several functions that allow the user to select options, show the text, as well as testNodes to handle the different scenarios and events.

# Future Work

- I'd like to add more scenarios or make them a little more diverse.
- I'd like to edit some of the HTML and CSS a little further to make the contrast better and the background image nicer.
- Some of the alignment of the text could be improved and I'd also like to allow the user to restart at any point of the game.
